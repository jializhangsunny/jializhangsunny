<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b> Virtual Reality (VR) offers the potential for more engaging access to Intangible Cultural Heritage. We present the design of a VR system(QiaoLe) in which people can access and learn about traditional Chinese musical instruments. We undertook a user study of QiaoLe(24 participants) comparing three interaction modes. Results suggest that embodied interaction and gamification improved usersâ€™ experience, presence, and enjoyment in QiaoLe, but gamification may distract from rote learning.</p>
